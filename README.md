This web application was developed by three passionate individuals - two Frontend (FE) (Dejan Žarković, Nemanja Radoman) and one Backend (BE) developer (Srecko Krečković) - in just three weeks, following a two-week summer course in React and Django. We are excited to present this project to you and hope you find it useful for planning your next vacation!
